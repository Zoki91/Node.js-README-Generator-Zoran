# Node.js README Generator – ZORAN


## Description
This project is a README generator project which is created with Node.js on the terminal. I built this project so that when I am creating open-source projects on GitHub it can provide any software engineer or any first-time user the basics of my project and how to run it and use it. It also gives them a little bit of information about me.  I learnt a lot about the inquirer npm package by creating this project.
